# findmypastproject- PRIME NUMBER MULTIPLICATION GENERATOR
How to Run this: Run PrimeMultiplicationTable application from bin to kick start this console application. Make sure the PrimeMultiplicationTableTDD.dll is in same directory.

What I am Pleased with: Pleased with the sieve of Sundaram implementation algorithm for prime number generation. I learnt TDD. formatting the table in console took a bit of time.

What would i do with it if i had more time: Start with using MVC, which i dint this time. Give it a webpage and get to display a dynamic table in it. Wasnt able to apply SOLID, KISS or YAGNI much, need more practice and understanding.
